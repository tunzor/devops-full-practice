# DevOps Practice Project
This is meant to be a project that uses several DevOps technologies to setup and configure an environment, build and deploy an app, and setup monitoring for it.

## Plan
1. Stand up cloud infrastructure with [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
2. Configure cloud machines with [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
3. Use [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to build and deploy and app to the cloud machines
4. Setup monitoring with a tool
